Website for the NeurIPS 2022's NL4Opt competition

The Natural Language for Optimization (NL4Opt) NeurIPS 2022 competition aims to improve the accessibility and usability of optimization solvers. The task of converting text description of a problem into proper formulations for optimization solvers can often be time-consuming and require an optimizations research expert. The participants will investigate methods of automating this process to be more efficient and accessible to non-experts. This competition aims to answer the following question: can learning-based natural language interfaces be leveraged to convert linear programming (LP) word problems into a format that solvers can understand?
