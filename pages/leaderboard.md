# Leaderboard

The leaderboard will be updated periodically and each participants submission will be evaluated by our organizers every Monday and Friday on the [anywhere on earth (AoE)](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe) time zone. Please refer to the template in the starter kit and tutorial for a step-by-step guide for the submission. To ensure that your latest submission is properly evaluated, we recommend you to update your submission to the cloud folder (provided to you in an email from our organizers) on the Sunday or Thursday.
